# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? *Conditionals are useful any time you're trying to use the content of a variable to answer a question.*
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? *I would slow down a little bit and make sure I'm not doing redundant work. KVG pointed out that you can solve the FizzBuzz challenge without an and statement using LCM. Not a lot of extra work to use an and statement, but certainly not as elegant.*
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? *Working though my own explanation for the modulo operator in the spicy challenge was very satisfying. Taking the time to explain it in my own words and with my own examples helped solidify my understanding of the concept.*
